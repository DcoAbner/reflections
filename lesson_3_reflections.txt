When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-if you are using multiple computers to do work (e.g. at office, home, etc); if other people are sharing with you

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-if there are local changes that you don't want released publicly it would be better to keep them local and only push when ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-forks - basically a remote branch off of someone else (gives them credit for what has already been done; requires their permission to push back for further update)

-clone - creates an exact copy

-branch - local offshoot of a repository so that if you want to work on a new feature without affecting the rest of it
